To whom it may concern,

This is some of the codes that I have done in my online classes. 
I looked up Univeristy of Washinton's introduction computer science courses and 
it seems like I have done a few of the assigments. For example, I have done the 
assignment bases on geolocation. In my code, I have added Hofstra University.
I hope that you consider me for this prodigious program as I believe that I
have the knowledge background in computer science necessary. 

Thank you for your consideration,
Caitlin Howansky
